    description: "cacerts.tar file which contains the /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts file. /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts is generated when `ca-certificates-java` is installed or `update-ca-certificates -f` is run. Because of the timestamp embedded, the file is not deterministic. We commit this file in a GCS bucket and reuse in layer or container creation so determinism can be achieved."
